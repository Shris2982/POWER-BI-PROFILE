You can find here DAX Queries and Model information I used to create Weekly average  by country and Weekly Ordered and                        
Shipped amount visuals.
There are 3 visualization tracking different KPIs that senior managers wants to see for their business.
Lets check them out one by one:

Before moving with any of the visualization , the first step is to build a Calender date table. A calender date table is 
very integral part of a power bi model as most of the KPIs are monitored weekly, monthly,quarterly or yearly basis.

In this report I am creating Calender table with the help of Power Query: You can find the code in my power bi fille for it.

Lets start with the 1st visual
1. Order amount and shipped amount by month and year: So we have two dates in our Order table i.e Order date and shipped date. 
I have created one to many relationship between Order date column in orders table to date column in my calender table.
so for calculating the order amount we can have a simple DAX measure:
//
SUMX(Orders, Orders[OrderQuantity]*Orders[SalesPrice])
//
For calculating the shipped amountwe have two options:
first you can use USERELATIONSHIP fucntion - 
//
CALCULATE([Order Amount],USERELATIONSHIP(Calender[DateKey],Orders[ShipDateKey]))
//
or you can use the below DAX measure to alter the filter context and calculate shipped amount
// 
Shipped Amount = 
VAR First_date = FIRSTDATE(Calender[DateKey])
VAR Last_date = LASTDATE(Calender[DateKey])
VAR Filter_ =  FILTER(ALL(Orders), Orders[ShipDateKey] >= First_date && Orders[ShipDateKey] <= Last_date)
RETURN 
CALCULATE([Order Amount], Filter_)
//

Lets get onto next visual:
We need to calculate average order amount per week per country:

I have a weekending column in my calender date table which we will use to calculate this measure:
//
Weekly Average Sales = 
VAR Total_Order = [Order Amount] / [No_Of_Week]
VAR CountryNo = DISTINCTCOUNT(Orders[Territory.Country])
RETURN
IF (
    NOT ISBLANK(SELECTEDVALUE('Orders'[Territory.Country])),
    Total_Order,
    Total_Order / CountryNo
)
//

Our third and final visual is Bar chart by week:
You can use the same Order amount measure and Shipped amount measure in the y-axis but remember to use Weekending
column in the x-axis and make it categorical.
